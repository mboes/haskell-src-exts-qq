Write programs that generate Haskell programs much more concisely and
legibly. This package supports:

* Antiquotations, denoted by stealing the splice syntax of Template
Haskell, for example:
    ```Haskell
    [hs| $x ++ $(Hs.strE "bar") |]
    ```
Splices may not nested.

* Antiquoting pattern variables in patterns, using double parentheses.
For instance:
    ```Haskell
    let x = Hs.name "n"
    in [hs| \ ((x)) -> $(Hs.Var () (Hs.UnQual () x)) + 1 |]
    ```

* Antiquoting bound names. Names that are antiquoted appear surrounded
by double underscores. For instance:
    ```Haskell
    let f = "incr"
        fE = Hs.Var () $ Hs.UnQual () $ Hs.name f
    in [hs| let __f__ x = x + 1 in $fE 10 |]
    ```

We need three different syntaxes for antiquotations, because we do not
extend the [haskell-src-exts][haskell-src-exts] parser in any way and
the Template Haskell splicing syntax is only available in expression
contexts.
